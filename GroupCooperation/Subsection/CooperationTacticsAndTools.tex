\subsection{Cooperation Tactics and Tools}
WRITTEN BY THOR 
How did you coordinate yourselves? Which tools did you use for this purpose?

\begin{itemize}
	\item Loose scrum to manage project and become familiar with it
	\item Work vs Social 
	\item Established official meeting hours and contact periods. Done to avoid stressful environment by separating study related activities from social life.
	\item Office hours 
	\item Communication (Facebook, Messenger, Facebook Group wall)
	\item Version Control (Git, Guidelines)
	\item Code conventions 
	\item Trello (Planning) 
\end{itemize}

General approach: started out with flexible meeting schedule and ended up with planned approach in Trello with a clear time schedule. Flexibility has been required due to other work.
