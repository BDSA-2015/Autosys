\subsection{Retrospect}

Would you retrospectively change something?

\begin{itemize}
	\item Stand up meetings
	\item Actual use of Trello
	\item Better planning in the start
	\item Working hours 
	\item Improved communication to avoid missing important content in major documents.
	\item Common terminology and terms arranged from the start. 
	\item More TA feedback 
	\item Earlier questions about the application domain to avoid extensive workload and misunderstandings (e.g. part of application domain). 
	\item Too fast to delegate. Avoided talking about the theory and establishing a common ground. Our approach has been a fail faster.
\end{itemize}
