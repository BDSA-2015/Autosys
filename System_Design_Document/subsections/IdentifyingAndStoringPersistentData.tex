\subsection{Identifying and Storing Persistent Data}
\paragraph{Identifying persistent objects}\mbox{}\\
Autosys deals with three sets of objects that must be stored.  The first set consists of research data that are accessed during conduction of secondary studies. The second set consists of objects that are created and accessed by the blue part of the system(eg. Users, roles, tasks). It need to be persistent to track the progress of the study, who is involved. The third set consists of data for a study configuration that are created by the study configuration UI.\\\\ The first set of objects is well defined and will rarely change during the lifetime of Autosys. These changes may occur whenever new research data has been created or removed and thus create a need for an update of the set. The second set of objects are managed and defined by the blue part of the system. Hence, we decide to let the blue part decide how to manage and access these persistent object through a generic interface. The third set of objects is also well defined and will not change once the study configuration has been made.

In this scope of the Autosys system, the main focus are set on the first and third set of persistent objects.  

\paragraph{Selecting a storage strategy}\mbox{}\\
By selecting and defining a persistent storage strategy enables us to deal with issues related to storage management. The main design goals of the yellow part of Autosys are to be reliable, scalable while also have high performance. It is therefore decided to implement a database management system because it allows concurrent queries and provide transaction mechanisms to ensure data integrity. \\\\Compared to a flat file storage method, a database management system will also scale to large installations with many researchers that are to conduct studies simultaneously. However, to allow future upgrades or changes it has been decided that the storage strategy is not solely dependent on a database management system. Thus, the Istorage subsystem will provide an abstract interface that enables other kinds of storage to be coupled. The users of Autosys are not able to change the storage, however if an update is ever needed for the storage strategy, a system administrator are able to do so.
