\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose of the System}
In \textbf{AUTOSYS}, the main client is the \textbf{SystemReviewClient} who needs to set up a \textbf{STUDY} consisting of one or several \textbf{PHASES}. A \textbf{PHASE} will consist of one or more \textbf{TASKS} which need to be completed before moving on to the next \textbf{PHASE}. The \textbf{StudyParticipants} can work in different \textbf{ROLES} which we anticipate will be either as \textbf{REVIEWER} or \textbf{VALIDATOR}. Also the \textbf{StudyParticipants} will be working together on a \textbf{STUDY} in \textbf{TEAMS}, but multiple teams will not be working on the same \textbf{STUDY}. Furthermore \textbf{TEAMS} working on the same \textbf{STUDY} will be considered as one big \textbf{TEAM}.


\subsection{Design Goals}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Ease of doing study configuration}: To increase efficiency, when working on Study configuration. Intuitive, gestalt laws.
\item \textit{High Reliability}: To make it possible to work with data even if you have no internet connection. Auto save of configuration data.
\item \textit{Scalability in terms of the amount of users, teams, and roles}:
\item \textit{High performance for data request processing time}: indexing in the database,
