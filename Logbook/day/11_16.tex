\begin{itemize}
	\item [\textbf{Meeting pins:}]
	\item Code Skeleton completed.
	\item Pull requests reviewed.
	\item Merged branches into master.
	\item Discussed work processes and how we contact each other outside ITU. Overall conflict is that study related activities seem not to be separated from other activities thus causing a tense stressful environment for certain members. One proposal is to keep track of each member's time board  so that people know when they can contact each other or when they should not be disturbed. This will be done with a document showing everyone's schedule and using status tags on Trello.

\begin{itemize}
	\item [\textbf{Sprint Planning:}]
	\item Need to plan future work and time for meetings to achieve a clear distinction between activities related to ITU and others.
