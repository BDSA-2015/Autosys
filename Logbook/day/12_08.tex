\begin{itemize}
	\item [\textbf{UI discussion:}]
	\item Phases should be organized in tabs.
	\item We need a frame for a Study and a frame for a Phase.
	\item How do we define phases dynamically (e.g. 2 tabs vs 10 tabs)?
	\item We need a process so show how far the user is in the configuration of a study.
	\item We need a front page for an overview (new study, update study, load protocol).
	\item You can first assign roles in a Phase. 
	\item Scroll functionality should be used upon many team members in the list.
