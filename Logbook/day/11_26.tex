\begin{itemize}
	\item [\textbf{Work planning:}]
	\item Add new title in each logbook, which detials any radical design changes.
	\item Thor and dennis has been working on a revicited entity relation model to be able to create the database
	\item We have desided to use a microsoft database to avoid any conflict between different types of databases
	\item We don't need to worry about database queing. Aparently c \# will automaticly handled that aspect. According to Mokkel TA , each task will automaticly queue up to be proceessed. I don't think this will solve it on the client side, but that is hardly our problem 
	\item You might want facilitate regular expressions in the search  to enable more advanced searches. Instead of asking does this name appear in the text, then you can ask, I want to sample papers where this name appeared at least 8 times.
