\begin{itemize}
	\item [\textbf{Meeting pins:}]
	\item Rework database design
	\item Working on Criteria
	\item paperManagement
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item [\textbf{Sprint Planning:}]
	\item Talk with TA about database design
	\item Discuss Test driven development 
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item [\textbf{Work planning:}]
	\item Add the new title in each logbook, which details any radical design changes.
	\item Thor and Dennis have been working on a revised entity relation model to be able to create the database
	\item We have decided to use a Microsoft database to avoid any conflict between different types of databases
	\item We don't need to worry about database queuing. Apparently c \# will automatically handle that aspect. According to Mikkel TA, each task will automatically queue up to be processed. I don't think this will solve it on the client side, but that is hardly our problem 
	\item You might want to facilitate regular expressions in the search  to enable more advanced searches. Instead of asking does this name appear in the text, then you can ask, I want to sample papers where this name appeared at least 8 times.
	
	\item [\textbf{Work accomplished today:}]
	\item E\\R model created 
	\item Subsystem dependency resolved: Create exportable item Interface To expose methods for formatting exporting Criteria, Protocol and Criteria will implement CRUD
	\item Database Dispose has been replaced by Using blocks 
	\item Database connection is maintained upon  methods calls
	\item Created Facade package in application logic, used to translate entities to storage 
	\item Repository has been moved to storage, and will now contain concrete repositories for all entities
	
	\item \textbf{William} is working on the Paper management class
	\item \textbf{Jacob} is working on the Phase and Criteria classes
	\item \textbf{Dennis} User management class
	\item \textbf{Thor} Storage, IFasade
\end{itemize}
