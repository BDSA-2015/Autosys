\section{Introduction}
This document will describe our reflection of the testing phase, our current implementation of our tests and the test we plan to incorporate in the future. We hope, by including tests in our early project stages will help us to better our design and catch errors which otherwise would have slipped past us. We firmly believes bugs and errors are easier to correct if the are caught early, and it will prevent them from snowballing and pick up size and scale.\\
We do not believe we are able to catch and eliminate all bugs and errors, but we have faith in a strong presence of tests will strengthen our products robustness
