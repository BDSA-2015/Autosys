We have tried to use the Adapter pattern in the Storage Adapters in the Application Logic. These have the responsibility to map data objects from the Application Logic to the Storage layer and the database using AutoMapper to convert the objects and the Storage repositories to finally write the objects to the database. To sum up, the idea was to use the Adapters to translate data objects from the solution domain to the database accessed in the Storage layer. By way of example, a StudyAdapter in the StoragePackage in the Application domain should map a User entity to a StoredUser entity as represented in the Storage layer and use the UserRepository and the derived CRUD functionalities. In this way, all callbacks to the database would only happen one place in the Application Logic (Storage package). The Adapters could then allow the underlying repository functionalities in the Storage layer to be used by a MainHandler in the Application Logic that receives client requests from the Web Api. The MainHandler should then implement the IAdapter interface like the Adapter classes to support dependency injection in the constructor. To conclude, this would allow to use an Adapter decided by the request circumstances.
