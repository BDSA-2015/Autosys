The Object Design Document has been used to describe the numerous considerations and design choices that we strived to apply. In our case, they were used to conform with the actual implementation of the Facade, Adapter and Repository pattern. Firstly, the Facade pattern strategy was taken into account for the communication between the Web Api and the Application Logic with its underlying functionalities. Secondly, the Adapter pattern was strived to be used in the Application Logic to map data objects and write them to the database by using the underlying repositories in the Storage layer. Thirdly, the Repository pattern principles were used to separate the data layer from the solution domain logic. %Overall, the Web Api uses a facade in the Application Logic. The Application Logic should then use Handlers for each subsystem and adapters to convert data objects to a format supported by Entity Framework and the database by using repositories in the Storage layer.  
To conclude, these decisions have put emphasis on the modular system design outlined in our code skeleton where functionalities are only used from a top down hierarchical approach.
